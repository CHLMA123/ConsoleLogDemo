/**
 项目中的AppDelegate，发现很多写在- application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:中的代码都只是为了在程序启动时获得一次调用机会，多为某些模块的初始化工作，如：
 [[MZDDLogManager sharedInstance] setupCocoaLumberjack];//打印信息初始化
 其实这些代码完全可以利用Notification的方式在自己的模块内部搞定，详细见MZDDLogManager得load方法。
 
 给 AppDelegate 瘦身的建议：
 
 AppDelegate 作为程序级状态变化的 delegate，应该只做路由和分发的作用，具体逻辑实现代码还是应该在分别的模块中，这个文件应该保持整洁，除了<UIApplicationDelegate>的方法外不应该出现其他方法。
